### ptrc dotfiles

a highly opinionated set of dotfiles, including, but not limited to:
- zshrc with a bunch of aliases
- dinit user services
- some default envs for a sway-based desktop environment
- a bunch of utility scripts in `bin/`

to install, `source install.zsh` from zsh

to pull local modifications back into the repo, `./snapshot.zsh`
